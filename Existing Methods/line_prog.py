| Weight  | Term            | Meaning                                                     |
| ------- | --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `alpha` | Cleanliness     | Encourages cleaner (renewable) energy sources (low score)   |
| `beta`  | Node count      | Penalizes selecting too many nodes (compact solution)       |
| `gamma` | Edge connection | Penalizes expensive transmission links (total edge weights) |

Interpreting Your Variants
üîπ result1 = lp_node_selection(..., alpha=10, beta=1, gamma=0.01)
Emphasis: Clean energy

Interpretation: "Prioritize cleaner sources, but still keep cost and node count modest"

Result: Favors solar/wind nodes even if they are farther or more numerous.

üîπ result2 = lp_node_selection(..., alpha=100, beta=1, gamma=0.01)
Emphasis: VERY strong clean energy preference

Interpretation: "I want the cleanest solution possible, cost and compactness are secondary"

Result: Could skip dirty but cheap nodes entirely; may include more nodes to meet power.

üîπ result3 = lp_node_selection(..., alpha=1, beta=1, gamma=0.01)
Balanced

Interpretation: "I want a compromise ‚Äî not too dirty, not too many nodes, not too costly"

Result: Likely most balanced result (often used as baseline or default)
