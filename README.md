Modern smart electricity grids must switch rapidly between different power stations due to the intermittent nature of renewable energy. We built a novel algorithm that significantly speeds up this process while intelligently selecting power stations based on several parameters.

The algorithm works by modifying Kruskal's minimum spanning tree algorithm. It selects power stations from a large network of interconnected stations. It focusses on selecting renewable power stations over dirty fossil-fuel based stations. It minimizes transmission costs by selecting power grids closer to the source first.

The mstStack algorithm was compared with existing optimization algorithms like Heuristics, Greedy Method and Linear Programming and was found to perform better while also making better selection of power stations.ï»¿# Smart-Grid-Optimization
